Skill Up 3 Java and Android Bootcamp Syllabus

Java Basics
How Java works
We will learn how Java code structure. Understanding what a class, method and variable is. Then practice on loops and conditional branching.

Object Oriented Programming
You will learn how classes relate to objects, methods and instance variables. We will briefly talk about the 'Heap'. We will also tackle Inheritance and Overriding which is an important principle in OOP.

Variables
We will deep dive into primitive and reference variables. We will understand how constructors work to declare and assign objects. We will also work on arrays.

States and Behavior
Classes define what an object knows (state) and what it does (behavior). In this section, we will discuss how method use instance and local variables as parameters and what methods return. We also learn the importance of encapsulation and how to effectively use getters and setters.


Using the Java API
The Java API abstracts several functions that helps us develop our application faster. In this section, we will learn how to read Java documentation. We will also tackle ArrayList which is one of the most used class in Java.


Advanced OOP
In this section e will learn good practices on inheritance through using the IS-A and HAS-A. Included is section is also best practices for Overriding and overloading methods.

Polymorphism
In this section we will deep dive on Polymorphism. We will take advantage of Abstract and interface classes so that we can design our code more efficiently.


Stack and Heap
In this section we will learn the Stack and Heap to understand the life of an object and how methods are called. We will revisit constructors, overloaded constructors, and superclasses


Math
In this section, we will learn about Static classes, methods and variables through the Math Class. We will look at how we can use static methods to modify variables. Lastly, we will also learn about Constants.


Handling exception
Sometimes errors are beyond our control which is why they need to be handled gracefully. In this section, we will learn how to use try-catch and when to use it properly.

Java I/O
In this section we will cover how Java can receive and send data to files using streams. We will look at how objects are serialized and deserialized.
Serialization

Threads
Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources. To deal with asynchronous transactions we have to consider multithreading and synchronized methods. In this section we will tackle the Thread and Runnable class and how to use synchronized methods.


Data Structures
All software engineers should know data structures as it is one of the foundations of programming. Choosing the right data structure for your program will help you program more efficiently. In this section, we will touch on Generics, Collections, and WildCards


Android

Introduction to Android Studio
In this section, we will introduce you to Android Studio IDE and how to work on common UI elements of an Android app

Media: Images, Video and Sound
In this section, we will learn animations, adding videos and sounds to your Android application.

Advanced Topics
We will cover several topics in this section.
List Views
Threading, Handlers and Runnables
Hiding/Unhiding UI Elements
Try and Catch
Async Tasks
HTTP Url Connections, API, JSON Data

Maps & Geolocation
In this section, we will learn how to use Android's location APIs to interact with GoogleMaps with Android.

Data & Storage
In this section, we will learn how to read and write data in SQLite for Android then proceed to Realm database afterwards.

Applications that we will develop throughout the course

Instagram Clone
Uber Clone
Twitter Clone
Whatsapp Clone
Imgur Clone
and many more!
